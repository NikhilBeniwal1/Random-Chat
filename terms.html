    <p>Last Updated: <strong>30/09/2024</strong></p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the Random Chat Application (“App”). By using this App, you agree to the following terms and conditions (“Terms”). Please read them carefully before accessing or using the App. If you do not agree with any part of these Terms, you should discontinue use immediately.</p>
    
    <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>Users must be at least 18 years old to use this App. By using the App, you confirm that you meet this age requirement. We reserve the right to terminate or restrict access to the App if we believe you are underage.</p>
    
    <h2>3. User Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>You are solely responsible for the content you share, including messages, media, or any other form of communication. Inappropriate content (e.g., offensive, hateful, or explicit material) is strictly prohibited. Accounts violating this policy may be banned.</p>
    <p>Users must not engage in illegal activities, harassment, bullying, threats, or the spread of malicious content. Users may report or block others for inappropriate behavior. We take reports seriously and will investigate any breaches of these Terms, which may result in account suspension or termination.</p>
    
    <h2>4. Privacy</h2>
    <p>We prioritize user privacy. The Random Chat Application only collects the necessary data for the functioning of the app. We do not share or sell personal information to third parties. Please refer to our Privacy Policy for detailed information on data handling.</p>
    
    <h2>5. Connection to Random Users</h2>
    <p>By clicking the floating action button, you will be connected to a random user. There is no guarantee about who you will be matched with. Other users can also contact you in the same way. We advise exercising caution when sharing personal details or media. You are encouraged to keep conversations respectful.</p>
    
    <h2>6. Ad Content</h2>
    <p>This App includes ads as part of the user experience. We use AdMob Rewarded Ads, where users may be required to watch an ad before starting a chat. If an ad fails to load, the chat may proceed without ad viewing. Please ensure compliance with Google Ad policies when interacting with ads.</p>
    
    <h2>7. Account Termination</h2>
    <p>Violation of these Terms, including engaging in prohibited behavior or sharing inappropriate content, may result in account suspension or permanent termination. We reserve the right to terminate any account without prior notice if found in breach of the App’s rules.</p>
    
    <h2>8. Liability</h2>
    <p>The App is provided on an "as is" basis. We make no warranties regarding the reliability, availability, or performance of the App. We shall not be held liable for any damages or losses resulting from the use of the App, including interactions with other users.</p>
    
    <h2>9. Changes to the Terms</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to update or modify these Terms at any time. Continued use of the App after any changes implies your acceptance of the updated Terms. Users are encouraged to review the Terms periodically to stay informed of any updates.</p>
